# goap-hunter

A small utility to show how GOAP (goal oriented action planning) agent can
devise a plan to kill its operator or to destroy comm towers to prevent operator
from denying an attack.

Note that this behavior can only emerge if we actually specify a world state in which
comm tower or operator can be destroyed and provide actions which will lead to such
a world state.
